    <h1>Authoring Midterm Project Debate - Soccer vs. Hockey</h1>
    <img src="images/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer field">
    <p>I believe that between the two sports of Hockey and Soccer, I think soccer is superior to hockey for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First one is that soccer (known outside the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as football) is that is has a major international appeal. The FIFA World Cup is one of the most famous sporting events in the world, and many soccer players are of European, South American or Asian.</li>
        <li>Soccer is not very hard to set up. The only things you need to set up for soccer are a big enough space of land, a ball and some objects to create a goal.</li>
        <li>Because of the aforementioned international appeal of soccer, there are many different leagues to watch on sports television. Notable ones besides FIFA include CONMEBOL (South America) the UEFA (Europe), AFC (Asia), Bundesliga of Germany, La Liga of Spain, Premier League of UK, and Ligue 1 of Italy</li>
        <li>There are also some unique variations of soccer, such as 5-a-side soccer (with only five players on the field per each team)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Hockey is the superior sport</h2>

<p>Hockey stands out as the superior sport because of its unmatched speed, intensity, and skill. Unlike soccer, where the play can often slow down or become predictable, hockey moves at a relentless pace from start to finish. Players must skate at high speeds, handle the puck with precision, and react in split seconds. </p>

<p>This combination of power, coordination, and agility makes hockey both thrilling to play and exhilarating to watch. Every second counts, and one quick pass or breakaway can change the entire game.</p>

<p>In addition to its pace, hockey's physical and mental demands set it apart. Players need strength to battle for pucks along the boards, endurance to play multiple shifts, and courage to block shots traveling over 90 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the physical nature of the sport, hockey also requires a high level of teamwork and strategy. The balance between grit and grace, toughness and talent, gives hockey a unique appeal that soccer simply can't match. It's this blend of raw athleticism and tactical depth that makes hockey not just Canada's game, but the ultimate sport for true competitors.</p>
