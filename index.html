    <h1>Midterm Project Debate - Ice Hockey vs. Soccer</h1>
    <img src="images/soccer.jpg">
    <p>I believe that between the two sports of Hockey and Soccer, I think Soccer is superior to hockey for the following reasons</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First one is that soccer (known outside the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as football) is that is has a major international appeal. The FIFA World Cup is one of the most famous sporting events in the world, and many soccer players are of European, South American or Asian.</li>
        <li>Soccer is not very hard to set up. The only things you need to set up for soccer are a big enough space of land, a ball and some objects to create a goal.</li>
        <li>Because of the aforementioned international appeal of soccer, there are many different leagues to watch on sports television. Notable ones besides FIFA include CONMEBOL (South America) the UEFA (Europe), AFC (Asia), Bundesliga of Germany, La Liga of Spain, Premier League of UK, and Ligue 1 of Italy</li>
        <li>There are also some unique variations of soccer, such as 5-a-side soccer (with only five players on the field per each team)</li>
    </ul>
